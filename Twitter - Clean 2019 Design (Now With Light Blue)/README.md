*It's same new Twitter, except much cleaner and little bit better.* üê¶

- Changes white background color to light blue *(only enabled in white theme)*
- Removes annoying elements such as trends, promoted tweets, "who to follow" boxes etc.
  - And more with **recommended uBlock filterlist!**
- Other really minor tweaks / style changes.

## Notes

This userstyle can't remove everything because limitations of current CSS and complexity of layout.
So I also made uBlock filterlist that removes even more elements, that are harder to do otherwise.

**[Click here to see the filterlist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krisu5/userstyles/master/Twitter%20-%20Clean%202019%20Design%20(Now%20With%20Light%20Blue)/filterlist.txt)**

- First, if you haven't already, install **uBlock Origin:** [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) or [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
  - **Uninstall Adblock Plus and other similar adblockers! Only one adblocker is necessary!** [More info here](https://twitter.com/gorhill/status/1195016403486683136)
- Then: [How to import manually a filterlist](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-lists-from-around-the-web)
- Also: You can copy the filter rules and add manually to uBlock Origin if you want, but you miss updates.

This userstyle and filterlist works **ONLY** with default english language (I'm not adding support for other languages). Works best with white theme, but other themes are partially supported for element blocks.
