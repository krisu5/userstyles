*It's same new Twitter, except little bit better and much cleaner.*

Changes white background color to light blue (only enabled in white theme), removes annoying elements such as trends, promoted tweets, "who to follow" boxes (and more with recommended uBlock filterlist!) and other really minor tweaks.

## Notes

This userstyle can't remove everything because of limitations of current CSS.
So I also made uBlock filterlist that removes even more elements, that are harder to do otherwise.

**Get filterlist here:** https://pastebin.com/raw/bDE8fjGT

- First, if you haven't already, install **uBlock Origin:** Chrome extension or Firefox extension
- Then: How to import manually a filterlist
- Also: You can copy the filter rules and add manually to uBlock Origin if you want, but you miss updates.

This userstyle and filterlist works **ONLY** with default english language (I'm not adding support for other languages). Works best with white theme, but other themes are partially supported for element blocks.
