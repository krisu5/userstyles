*It's same new Twitter, except much cleaner and little bit better.* üê¶

- Toggleable option to change white background color to light blue *(enabled by default, only in "default white theme")*
- Removes annoying elements such as trends, promoted tweets, "who to follow" boxes etc.
  - And more with **recommended uBlock filterlist!**
- Other really minor tweaks / style changes.

## Notes

This userstyle can't remove everything because limitations of current CSS and complexity of layout.
So I also made uBlock filterlist that removes even more elements, that are harder to do otherwise.

**[Click here to see the filterlist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krisu5/userstyles/master/Twitter%20-%20Clean%202019%20Design%20(Now%20With%20Light%20Blue)/filterlist.txt)**

- First, if you haven't already, install **uBlock Origin.** [Extensions for browsers listed here](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin).
  - **Uninstall Adblock Plus and other similar adblockers! Only one adblocker is necessary!** Seriously, [more info here](https://twitter.com/gorhill/status/1033706103782170625).
- Then: [How to import manually a filterlist](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-lists-from-around-the-web).
- Also, you can copy the filter rules and add manually to uBlock Origin if you want, but you miss the updates.

This userstyle and filterlist works **ONLY with English language** (I'm not adding support for other languages).

Works best with default white theme, but other themes are supported for element blocks.

## Extra additions for the style

Optional userstyles, made by me.

- [Twitter - Custom font](https://github.com/krisu5/userstyles/raw/master/_Misc/twitter_-_custom_font.user.css) - Change the font of Twitter to some other font on PC (my recommentation: ["IBM Plex Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans))
- [Twitter - Hide FB-like DM drawer](https://github.com/krisu5/userstyles/raw/master/_Misc/twitter_-_hide_fb-like_dm_drawer.user.css) - Hide direct message box from bottom right.

## Recommended userscripts

Optional userscripts by other developers, that in my option makes Twitter so much better again.

- [I like latest tweets !](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/400695-i-like-latest-tweets) - Always changes to "latest tweets" in the home timeline
- [Twitter Direct](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/404632-twitter-direct) - Replaces t.co URLs in tweets to actual URLs
- [MoreTweetsBuster](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/397988-moretweetsbuster) - Redirects to actual twitter thread from "more tweets" layout when clicking Twitter link outside of Twitter (works 90% of the time)
- [Remove "more tweets" from shared links on twitter](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/434551-remove-more-tweets-from-shared-links-on-twitter) - Similar function to "MoreTweetsBuster" (I recommend installing both).
